Iâ€™ve been in software engineering since 2015, building my career as a front-end engineer before moving into engineering management, solutioning, and architecture. In 2025, I made a full shift back to hands-on building and founded [Brizzy](https://brizzy.app), a one-tap breathing app that makes self-regulation simple and accessible.

 My strategy is to leverage AI-driven workflows to multiply personal productivity, capture that edge inside my own company, and turn it into software that creates meaningful value in the world.

Beyond code, I write about strategy, business, engineering, information design, and philosophy. Please check more in [Works](/works).
